# Face Detection Algorithm
### The algorithm that detects faces


#### Run a single file test on the new algorithm: tutorial.py

- runs the new modified algorithm on a single file whose name is passed into the detector. Change this to alter the file being tested
- no-data mode: runs the test on the file and returns if it is a face, and if so if it is a face in the library (old face) or a face not in the library (new face)
- data mode: runs the test of the file and returns the minimum d value and the filename for the library image that is the closest match 


#### Run a test on a library with 10 old images, 10 new images, and 5 non-face images (test mentioned in report): TestFaceDetection.py
- no user input is required, simply run the code as is (ie. python TestFaceDetection.py)
